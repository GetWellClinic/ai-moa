## Introduction: ##

Aimee AI is helpful medical office assistant that sorts, labels, describes the content of documents,
tags to ordering provider, and attaches faxes/scans to the patient's chart in the EMR. Aimee AI (AI Medical Office Assistant)
operates locally, so no private data leaves the server.

## Installation ##

**Be sure to change working directory to "gwc-aimee" where this readme.md and installation files are stored, before executing the installation files.**

### 1. Install Ubuntu 22 LTS ###

**Notes:**
If you plan on installing this in a VM such as on ProxMox VE, here are some tips:
- Enable virtualization on the bare metal machine in the BIOS
- Enable IOMMU in BIOS
- Enable [PCI passthrough](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/PCI_Passthrough) for Proxmox VE. This is a helpful Youtube [instructional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWX3iWcka_0)

### 2. Clone the AI-MOA repository from Github ###

You will need to have your Github user name and a personal access token (generated from your account on Github). Github no longer allows 'git clone' access with passwords, and must use an access token generated from your user account online from Github.
```
cd /opt
sudo git clone https://github.com/getwellclinic/ai-moa.git
cd /opt/ai-moa
sudo chown $USER /opt/ai-moa/* -R
```

**Select the "Aimee IA" branch to Git checkout** ```dev-gwc-aimee```. (The default branch is usually "main")
```
cd /opt/ai-moa
git checkout dev-gwc-aimee
cd gwc-aimee
ls -l -h
nano Readme.md
```

**Set file permissions to enable run installation scripts**
```
cd /opt/ai-moa/gwc-aimee
ls -l -h
sudo chmod ug+x *.sh
sudo chmod g-x install*
sudo chmod g-x uninstall*
```

### 3. Install NVIDIA RTX video card drivers ###

Install your GPU in the PCIe slot, boot up your server, and install the video card drivers for your machine.

**Install NVIDIA Video Driver**

Check for NVIDIA video card drivers
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-drivers-common
sudo ubuntu-drivers devices
```

Select the best driver to install. Pick the latest recommended one. (ie. nvidia-driver-550)

```
sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver-550
```

Reboot the server for the changes to take effect.
```
sudo shutdown -r now
```

Once system is rebooted, check to see if NVIDIA RTX video card is installed:
``` 
nvidia-smi
```

*You should see something like this:*
```

```

### 4. Install NVIDIA Toolkit Container ###

Add the Repository for NVIDIA Container Toolkit
```
curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg \ && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | \ sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \ sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list
```

Update and install the latest nvidia-container-toolkit
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nvidia-container-toolkit
```

Restart the server for the installation to take effect.
```
sudo shutdown -r now
```

### 5. Install Docker and Docker Compose ###

Follow online instructions to install Docker and Docker Compose.

Or

Use our custom "install-docker.sh" scrip to install automatically:
```
sudo ./install-docker.sh
```

### 6. Configure Docker to use NVIDIA Container Toolkit ###
```
sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### 7. Install AI LLM Container ###

This installed the default AI Lare Language Model Docker Container for AI-MOA.
```
sudo ./install-llm.sh
```

### 8. Install Aimee AI (AI-MOA) ###

This installs "Aimee AI" version of AI-MOA, by setting up custom settings and prerequisites.
```
./install-aimoa.sh
```

### 9. Install *Aimee AI* as a system service (Recommended) ###

This optional step, installs *Aimee AI* as a system service that automatically starts at system startup/reboot.
If you install this option, both the LLM Container and AI-MOA will start in the background and keep running.

Install "Aimee AI" as a system service
```
./install-services.sh
```


## Configuration ##

To configure your *Aimee AI*, please edit the parameters in the following configuration files.
```
sudo nano ../config/config.yaml
sudo nano ../config/workflow-config.yaml
```

### 1. Edit "../config/config.yaml" file ###

Particularly, pay attention to the section on "emr" that is unique to your EMR server.
```
emr:
	base_url:
	username:
	password:
	pin:
```

When you are ready to process documents, edit the "../config/workflow-config.yaml" file to the last document
in your EMR from where you want to start AI-MOA to start processing documents.
The default "pending: 9999999" has been set at a very unlikely high number to prevent default installations
from processing live documents until you are ready.

To find out what is the last document uploaded:
- upload a test PDF to InBox via "Doc Upload".
- click on the star beside the InBox* which lists all the Unassigned documents.
- view the latest uploaded document, usually at the top of the list "Not, Assigned (NEW)"
- examine the URL and look for "&segmentID=####", this number is the document ID.
- enter this document ID as the "pending" number
```
inbox:
	pending: #######
```
**WARNING** Once you save this config.yaml file with the new pending ###,
your AI-MOA will likely start processing the InBox PDF documents !

**Check if there is a lock on config.yaml file:**
During processing, there is "lock:status:true" on the config files. However, this may sometimes be left on
inadvertantly and prevent the AI-MOA from processing the next file.
Sometimes, you may need to reset the "lock:status:false".
```
lock:
	status: false
```

### 2. Edit "../config/provider_list.yaml" file ###

Once you run AI-MOA once, it will attempt to automatically upload a Report by Template and generate
a SQL search to extract the provider names and provider_id from your EMR.
It will save to a YAML file, which AI-MOA will use to match to names in documents.

To improve accuracy, edit the YAML file to delete extraneous or unneccessary providers that AI-MOA
does not need to match documents to that name. If there are too many similar providers, it can
confuse the LLM.

```
sudo nano ../config/provider_list.yaml
```

If you do not see this file, wait, or complete the configuration steps and then start Aimee AI manually by command line (See section: Maintenance Operations)

### 3. Create new EMR user: AI, MOA ###

**Create AI MOA user in EMR**

Aimee AI will access the EMR with a user account you create for her.

1. Login to EMR
2. Administration -> Add a Provider Record:
	- Provider No: **200**
	- Last Name: AI
	- First Name: MOA
	- Sites Assigned: (select your site)
	- Status: Active
3. Administration -> Assign Role to Provider:
	- Find Provider No. **200** (MOA AI)
		- Add "doctor" role
		- Add "receptionist" role
	- Scroll to bottom: Update Primary EMR Role:
		- Select Provider: AI, MOA
		- Assign AI, MOA primary Role: **receptionist**
		- Click "Update Primary EMR Role" to save settings.
4. Administration -> Add a Login Record:
	- Create new user for Aimee AI
		- User Name: aimoa
		- Password: *********
		- Confirm: *********
		- Provider No: **200**
		- Expiry Date: (**uncheck box**)
		- Time Cycling Pin (2FA): **No**
		- Pin (remote) Enable: **Checkmark**/yes
		- Pin (local) Enable: (uncheck or check)
		- Force Password Reset: **No**
		- Save settings by clicking "Add Record"
5. Update "config.yaml" file with AI, MOA login information.
(Please note: be sure to secure the server installation from any unauthorized access or use.)

**Create CONFIDENTIAL, UNATTACHED patient demographic record in EMR**

Aimee AI will file documents that do not have any corresponding patient record in the EMR to a generic chart for audit, tracking, and recovery purposes. This allows you to find records that are unattached to an actual patient, and make corrections (reattach to correct file). You may also use this to file away advertisements and junk faxes. It is best practice to label the document with the document's patient name, so your staff can do a search in the Document Manager to retrieve it if it was a mistake to file it in "CONFIDENTIAL, UNATTACHED"

1. Login to EMR
2. Click "Search" for a patient.
	- Enter "confidential" and click "Search", to check if existing patient record named "CONFIDENTIAL, UNATTACHED"
	- If one exist, then note down the demographic number of this chart, to specify as the "default_unidentified_patient_tagging_name:" field in "workflow-config.yaml"
3. Create Demographic:
	- Click "Create Demographic" and create a new chart
		- Lastname: CONFIDENTIAL
		- Firstname: UNATTACHED
		- Health Card Type: Other
4. Update "workflow-config.yaml"
	- Note the Demographic Number for "CONFIDENTIAL, UNATTACHED" and enter it as the "default_unidentified_patient_tagging_name:" for the YAML file.

**Create missing Document Categories**

AI-MOA is developed for identify and tagging according to certain Document Category Types as defined in "workflow-config.yaml".
	Some category names are missing in the default EMR installation. Check for document category types and create these missing categories so you can see the labels that Aimee AI tag.

1. Login to EMR
2. Administration -> System Management -> Document Categories:
		- Under "Demographic Document Categories", Show "all or 100" categories
		- Check for the presence of this standard Document Categories, and "Add New" for any missing categories (or Update Status to make them "A" - Active)

	**AI-MOA Standard Document Categories**

	- advertisement
	- consent
	- consult
	- diagnostics
	- insurance
	- lab
	- legal
	- miscellaneous
	- *notifications*
	- oldchart
	- *others*
	- pathology
	- pharmacy
	- photo
	- radiology
	- referral
	- request
	- requisition

		
## Maintenance Operations ##

### Running *Aimee AI* manually by command line ###

You can run *Aimee AI* manually start/stop with command line.

Stop the Aimee AI system service (ai-moa.service)
```
sudo service ai-moa stop
```

Check Aimee AI system status
```
sudo service status
```

Start *Aimee AI* manually
```
./run-aimoa.sh

To exit/stop Aimee AI
Ctrl-C
```

**Watching the workflow.logs**

You can also watch realtime logs of AI-MOA.
```
./watch-aimoa-logs.sh

To exit/stop watching
Crtl-C
```


### Start/Stop LLM Container ###

The AI LLM Container runs separately in docker as llm-container and caddy.
If you installed AI-MOA as a system service with "./install-services.sh", then you do not
need to start/stop LLM Container manually.

To stop the LLM Container manually:
```
sudo ./stop-llm.sh
```

To start the LLM Container manually:
```
sudo ./run-llm.sh
````

## Troubleshooting ##

### Uninstalling Aimee AI ###

To remove "Aimee AI" from running as a system service:
```
sudo ../uninstall-aimoa.sh
```

### Fixing Permissions ###

Sometimes, Aimee AI won't run properly, and your get permission errors in the log, because the permission for user:group are not set properly.

Fix this by running:
```
sudo ./fix-aimoa.sh
```

### AI-MOA is running, but no documents being processed ###

This may happen because of a file lock on config.yaml

Stop AI-MOA first before editing the config.yaml file
```
sudo service ai-moa stop
```

Edit config.yaml and remove file lock by setting "lock:status:false"
```
sudo nano ../config/config.yaml
```
Change setting to "false"
```
lock:
	status: false
```

Restart the AI-MOA service
```
sudo service ai-moa start
```
