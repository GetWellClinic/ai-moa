## Introduction: ##

Aimee AI is a helpful medical office assistant that sorts, labels, describes the content of documents,
tags to ordering provider, and attaches faxes/scans to the patient's chart in the EMR. Aimee AI operates locally,
so no private data leaves the server.

*"Aimee" was the name of an actual MOA who once worked with us at Get Well Clinic. We pay tribute to the many MOA's
who have worked at our clinic, who managed to keep their cool in the face of patient suffering, and still provided
excellent customer service in this demanding and thankless occupation. We hope this project will help reduce the
healthcare team's administrative burden, so we can dedicate ourselves to the very human activity that is healthcare.*
