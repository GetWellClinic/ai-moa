def get_local_documents(self):
    """
    Retrieves the first file from a local directory and sets it in the shared state.

    This method checks the specified input directory for files. If any files are found, it reads the 
    first file and sets the file content and its name into the shared state for further processing.

    The file is read in binary mode and stored in the shared state under two keys:
    - `current_file`: Stores the binary content of the file.
    - `current_file_name`: Stores the name of the file.

    The directory to search for the files is configurable through the `document_processor.local.input_directory` 
    setting, with a default value of '/app/input'.

    Args:
        None

    Returns:
        bool: 
            - `True` if a file is found, read successfully, and its content is stored in the shared state.
            - `False` if no files are found in the specified directory.
        
        Example:
            >>> result = get_local_documents()
            >>> print(result)
            True  # If a file was found and processed, or False if no file was found.
    
    Logs:
        - Logs the execution of the task using the logger: `Executing task get_local_documents`.

    Raises:
        OSError: If there is an issue accessing the directory or reading the file.
