    Check if the provided PDF contains text, indicating it has OCR.

    This method checks if any of the pages in the PDF have text content, 
    which would indicate that Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has been 
    applied to the document.

    Args:
        None

    Returns:
        bool: 
            - `True` if the PDF contains any text.
            - `False` if the PDF does not contain any text or if an error occurs.

    Example:
        >>> result = has_ocr()
        >>> print(result)
        True  # If OCR is detected in the document.

    Logs:
        - Logs an error if an exception occurs during OCR detection.
    
    Raises:
        Exception: If there is an issue loading or reading the PDF.

    Extract text from the provided PDF bytes using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

    This method uses the `doctr` library to perform OCR on the PDF document
