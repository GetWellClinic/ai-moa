def get_category_types(self):
    """
    Retrieves the category types by querying an AI model with a predefined prompt.

    This method constructs a prompt using the OCR text and a specific AI prompt related to category types, then
    queries the AI model for a response.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - bool: `True` if the query was successful.
            - str: The text response from the AI model.

    Example:
        >>> result, response = manager.get_category_types()
        >>> print(result, response)

    Retrieves the category type based on the OCR document content.

    This method constructs a prompt using the OCR text and a specific AI prompt related to category type, then
    queries the AI model for a response. It matches the AI model's response with the available document categories
    to find a corresponding category name.

    If a category name is found in the AI model's response, it is returned.
